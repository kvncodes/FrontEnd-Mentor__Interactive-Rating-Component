Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

If you would like the Figma design file to gain experience using professional tools and build more accurate projects faster, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## My process

As i said the thing that took me the most time on this was getting the hang of the clamp function.Before starting this i had never used it but now i feel a bit more familiar and really liked using it!!

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

clamp() function which is used for responsive designs.Its used in font sizes ,margins ,paddings ,widths ,heights etc,
